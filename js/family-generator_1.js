        were confident in their strength and met Constantinus on the field of battle outside of Carlion, an old Roman city in southeastern Cambria. Despite being outnumbered, \n\
        the Irish fought the battle to a standstill. Late in the afternoon several young and brave warriors from Salisbury broke through Irish lines and captured their standard single-handed, \n\
        waving it as a rallying cry before being cut down. In the mad rush to recapture their standard, the Irish collectively turned their backs on Constantinus soldiers. \n\
        The center collapsed and the battle quickly became a massacre as the disciplined British forces capitalized on the moment. \n\
